## Usage

* Each day's problem has a corresponding folder 01/, 02/, ...
* Each day's folder contains subfolders a/, b/ for both subproblems
* A subproblem is solved by `python3 solve.py [/path/to/puzzle/input.txt]` with optional argument, default is `input.txt`.
* `input.txt` can be saved locally for convenience, where `input*.txt` is ignored by git.
