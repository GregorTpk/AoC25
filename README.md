## Usage

* Each day's problem has a corresponding folder 01/, 02/, ...
* `solve.py` solves both subproblems of a day. It takes a file path as an optional command-line argument, default is `input.txt`.
* `input.txt` can be saved locally for convenience, where `input*.txt` is ignored by git.
* With the command line argument `-q`, a solver script only outputs the result without any text.
* Some solvers support more command line arguments. View them with `-h`. 

## Dependencies

* Day 10 requires `scipy` and `galois`.
