## Usage

* Each day's problem has a corresponding folder 01/, 02/, ...
* Most day's folders contain subfolders a/, b/ for the subproblems
* `solve.py` solves one or both subproblems. It takes a file path as an optional command-line argument, default is `input.txt`.
* `input.txt` can be saved locally for convenience, where `input*.txt` is ignored by git.
